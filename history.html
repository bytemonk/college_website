      <p style="text-align:justify">Maharaja Surajmal had the same reverence for all the religions. He believed that humanity is the only religion of man. He visualized India as one nation and devoted his life in forging national integration. Maharaja Surajmal nurtured intellectual vigour that reflects a fusion of our heritage and contemporary insights.

Maharaja Surajmal considered farmers as the most important section of the society and had a lot of respect for them. He personally identified the problems of the farmers and introduced reforms to rectify them.

He expanded his kingdom from Bharatpur to include Agra, Aligarh, Ballabgarh, Hodal, Bulandshahar, Dholpur, Etah, Hathras, Meerut, Mathura, Rohtak, Gurgaon, Farukh Nagar, Mewar and Rewari. Through out his life, he kept on fighting against social injustice, racial discrimination, superstitions and factitious groups and sacrificed his life on 25th Dec.1763 in Shahdara, Delhi.
