  <p style="text-align:justify">Information Technology department labs are well equipped with computers of latest configuration with LAN connectivity and Internet connection. Department comprises of various labs and details of labs are as follows:</p>

  <p><b>1. OS/CG-Multimedia Lab</b></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify">The OS and CG-MM Lab have a capacity of 30 computers of Acer i5 Processor, 2nd generation 3.0 GHz 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD configurations. This Lab is prepared to allow students to practice and perform practical of Computer Graphics and Multimedia subject on Autodesk Maya Software. It is a 3D computer graphics software that runs on Windows, OS and Linux. By using Autodesk Maya Software students are able to create interactive 3D applications with visual effects. The Computer Graphics Lab focuses on research in curve and surface design, rendering, perception, and user interfaces. In this lab, students understand and learn the need of developing graphic applications, concept of colour generation, representation & transformation of graphical images, pictures & algorithmic development of graphic primitives. Students are also encouraged to learn basic of graphics programming on Turbo C++ software.
  </P>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The Lab is well equipped with all advanced software's (Turbo C Version 4 Software) for practical applications. This lab serves as a platform for learning and implementing the Applied Mathematics lab in 'C' programming language. Lab Work is designed to help students to implement methods like Runga-kutta Method, Newton Raphsonâ€™s Method and various others. This Lab is also used for Linux & OS system programming practical.  For practical implementation CentOS 6.0 is installed on the machines in the Lab. The goal of this lab is to provide a practical introduction of the internal operation of modern operating systems. The course will cover algorithms for processes and threads, mutual exclusion, CPU scheduling, deadlock, memory management and file systems.

  <p><b>2. Network Programming Lab</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The Network Programming Lab under IT Department fulfils the Networking, Java and the Web Engineering lab requirements of the course curriculum prescribed by GGSIP University. It is well equipped with 30 systems of Acer i5 Processor 2nd generation 3.0 GHz 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD configuration with lab area of 72.8 Sq. mts. The students in this lab develop Networking programs, Java programs as well as programs for various Web based Applications. In networking, students get hands on training regarding the design and simulation of computer networks using Network Simulator 3 (NS3). They also learn about various network topologies and network protocols like sliding window, UDP, TCP and many others and perform socket programming. To learn JAVA programs the systems are installed with JDK1.7 and Net beans IDE which is an Open Source project environment and provides support for several languages (PHP), C/C++, JavaScript, etc.). The programs for Web Based Applications are developed using Net beans IDE and Apache Tomcat server. This lab provides the student with an opportunity to know about the various latest web technologies and a platform for research in computer networks.
